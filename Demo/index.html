                Ronaldo was born in São Pedro, Funchal, and grew up in the Funchal parish of Santo António,[3][4][5] as the youngest child
                of Maria Dolores dos Santos Aveiro, a cook, and José Dinis Aveiro, a municipal gardener and a part-time kit
                man.[6] His second given name, "Ronaldo", was chosen after then-U.S. president Ronald Reagan.[7] He has one
                older brother, Hugo, and two older sisters, Elma and Liliana Cátia.[1] His great-grandmother on his father's
                side, Isabel da Piedade, was from São Vicente, Cape Verde.[8] Ronaldo grew up in a Catholic and impoverished
                home, sharing a room with his brother and sisters.[9] As a child, Ronaldo played for amateur team Andorinha
                from 1992 to 1995,[10][11] where his father was the kit man,[12] and later spent two years with Nacional.
                In 1997, aged 12, he went on a three-day trial with Sporting CP, who signed him for a fee of £1,500.[13][14]
                He subsequently moved from Madeira to Alcochete, near Lisbon, to join Sporting's other youth players at the
                club's football academy.[15] By age 14, Ronaldo believed he had the ability to play semi-professionally,
                and agreed with his mother to cease his education in order to focus entirely on football.[16] While popular
                with other students at school, he had been expelled after throwing a chair at his teacher, who he said had
                "disrespected" him.[16] However, one year later, he was diagnosed with a racing heart, a condition that could
                have forced him to give up playing football. He underwent an operation in which a laser was used to cauterise
                the affected area of his heart; discharged from hospital hours after the procedure, he resumed training only
                a few days later.[17]

                Forbes has twice ranked Ronaldo first on their list of the world's highest-paid football players; his combined income from
                salaries, bonuses and non-football earnings was $73 million in 2013–14 and $79 million in 2014–15.[458][459]
                The latter earnings saw him listed behind only boxer Floyd Mayweather, Jr. on the magazine's list of The
                World's Highest-Paid Athletes.[460] In 2016, he became the first footballer to top the Forbes list of highest-earning
                athletes, with a total income of $88 million from his salary and endorsements in 2015–16.[461] He topped
                the list for the second straight year with earnings of $93 million in 2016–17.[462] Ronaldo is one of the
                world's most marketable athletes: SportsPro rated him the fifth most marketable athlete in 2012,[463] and
                eighth most marketable athlete in 2013, with Brazilian footballer Neymar topping both lists.[463][464] Sports
                market research company Repucom named Ronaldo the most marketable and most recognised football player in
                the world in May 2014.[465] He was additionally named in the 2014 Time 100, Time's annual list of the most
                influential people in the world.[466] ESPN named Ronaldo the world's most famous athlete in 2016 and 2017.[467][468]

                Personal life Ronaldo's father, José Dinis Aveiro, died of an alcoholism-related liver condition at age 52 in September 2005
                when Ronaldo was 20.[502][503] Ronaldo has said that he does not drink alcohol, and he received libel damages
                over a Daily Mirror article that reported him drinking heavily in a nightclub while recovering from an injury
                in July 2008.[504] "In football I don't have a lot of friends. People I really trust? Not many. Most of the
                time I'm alone. I consider myself an isolated person." –During the filming of his authorized biography, Ronaldo
                admitted to often preferring solitude while working, attributing it to his autonomous way of living.[373]
                Ronaldo became father to a son in June 2010.[505][506] Ronaldo announced that he had full custody.[507] Ronaldo
                has never publicly revealed the identity of his son's mother.[508] In June 2017, Ronaldo confirmed on Facebook
                that he had become the father to twins.[509][510] In November 2017, his girlfriend Georgina Rodriguez gave
                birth to their daughter.
